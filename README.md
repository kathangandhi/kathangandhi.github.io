# website
This repository is related to all my attempts at web development.

`index.html` holds all the main code. `styles.css` contains all the different styles/formats that are linked to the web content. `assets` folder contains all the multimedia resources that the website relies on.

Currently, the website is a single page with an introduction, a button that links to my resume, and my contact details in an organized layout.
