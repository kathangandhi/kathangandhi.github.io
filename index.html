                Nice to meet you, I'm Kathan Gandhi!
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley majoring in EECS 
                (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science). Undoubtedly, I am a very 
                passionate coder and always wanted to make my own website. Nevertheless, 
                my primary interests lie in the booming field of AI and I desire to 
                contribute in smart healthcare projects that possess great potential for 
                social welfare.
            </p>

                Outside my academic ambitions, I enjoy playing (e-)sports, engaging with 
                digital media, tasting diverse foods, and experiencing music. Recently, I
                started cooking due to my new responsibilities and dabbled in the stock 
                market as well.

                You might be here to just check my work out or genuinely get to know me.
                Either way, I hope the website serves you well.
