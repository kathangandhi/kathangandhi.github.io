                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Nice to meet you, I'm Kathan Gandhi!</p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley majoring in EECS 
                    (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science). Undoubtedly, I am a very 
                    passionate coder and always wanted to make my own website. Nevertheless, 
                    my primary interests lie in the booming field of AI and I desire to 
                    contribute in smart healthcare projects that possess great potential for 
                    social welfare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside my academic ambitions, I enjoy playing (e-)sports, engaging with 
                    digital media, and vibing to music. Recently, I started cooking in my 
                    college apartment as a part of my new responsibilities and dabbled in the 
                    stock market as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might be here to just check my work out or genuinely get to know me.
                    Either way, I hope the website serves you well.
                </p>
