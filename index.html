            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Nice to meet you, I'm Kathan Gandhi!</p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley majoring in EECS 
                (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science). Undoubtedly, I am a very 
                passionate coder and always wanted to make my own website. Nevertheless, 
                my primary interests lie in the booming field of AI and I desire to 
                contribute in smart healthcare projects that possess great potential for 
                social welfare.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside my academic ambitions, I enjoy playing (e-)sports, engaging with 
                digital media, and vibing to music. Recently, I started cooking in my 
                college apartment as a part of my new responsibilities and dabbled in the 
                stock market as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might be here to just check my work out or genuinely get to know me.
                Either way, I hope the website serves you well.
            </p>
